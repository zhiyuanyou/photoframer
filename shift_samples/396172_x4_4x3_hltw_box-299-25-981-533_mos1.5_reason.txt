To enhance the composition of the original image, reframe it by centering the butterfly more prominently within the frame. This adjustment ensures the butterfly is the clear focal point, drawing attention to its intricate wing patterns and delicate details. Additionally, crop out any unnecessary grass blades on the left side to eliminate distractions and create a cleaner, more balanced composition. By doing so, the greenery serves as a soft, natural backdrop that complements the butterfly without overpowering it, resulting in a more aesthetically pleasing and focused image.
