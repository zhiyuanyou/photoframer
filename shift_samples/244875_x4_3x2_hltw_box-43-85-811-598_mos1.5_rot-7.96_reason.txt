To enhance the composition, adjust the framing by cropping out the lower-left corner of the image, removing the dark silhouette of the landmass that disrupts the smooth flow of the water. Shift the focus slightly upward and to the right, ensuring the horizon line remains balanced but allowing more emphasis on the vibrant sunset colors and the distant hills. This change creates a cleaner, more cohesive visual path across the water, directing attention toward the warm hues and the subtle reflections on the surface. The result is a more serene and aesthetically pleasing scene, with improved symmetry and a stronger sense of tranquility.
