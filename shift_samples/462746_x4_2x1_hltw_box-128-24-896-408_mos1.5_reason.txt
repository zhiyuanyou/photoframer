To enhance the composition, crop the image to focus on the log cabin as the central subject, removing the distracting foreground grass and branches. Shift the framing slightly upward to emphasize the cabin's roofline and chimney, creating a stronger vertical element that draws the eye upward. Include more of the water body in the background to provide depth and context, balancing the cabin with its surroundings. This adjustment ensures the cabin remains the focal point while integrating the natural elements seamlessly, improving overall harmony and visual appeal.
