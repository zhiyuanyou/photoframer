To enhance the composition, crop the image to focus on the person in the red coat as the central subject, placing them slightly off-center to adhere to the rule of thirds. Remove the top portion of the image where the sky dominates, as it currently draws attention away from the main subject. Adjust the bottom edge to include more of the snowy path leading into the distance, creating a stronger leading line that guides the viewer's eye through the scene. This modification will emphasize the subject while maintaining the rural winter setting, improving overall balance and visual flow.
