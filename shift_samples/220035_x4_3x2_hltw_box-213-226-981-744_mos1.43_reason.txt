To enhance the composition, crop the image to focus on the two locomotives, removing the empty tracks and surrounding grassy areas that do not contribute significantly to the scene. Place the blue locomotive closer to the left side of the frame, adhering to the rule of thirds, which creates a more dynamic and balanced composition. Ensure the steam from the black locomotive is visible, adding movement and interest. This adjustment eliminates distractions and emphasizes the contrast between the modern blue locomotive and the classic black steam engine, making the image more visually engaging and aesthetically pleasing.
