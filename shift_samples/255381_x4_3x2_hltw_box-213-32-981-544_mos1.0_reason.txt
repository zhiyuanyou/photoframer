To enhance the composition, adjust the framing by lowering the horizon line to include more of the silhouetted palm trees and the ground below. This change will create a stronger visual anchor and balance the vibrant sky with the earthy tones of the landscape. Additionally, ensure the palm trees are evenly distributed across the frame to avoid any dominance by one side. This adjustment will emphasize the contrast between the warm sky and the dark silhouettes, adding depth and grounding the scene. Finally, consider including a portion of the street or pathway to introduce a leading line that draws the viewer’s eye into the image, enhancing the overall dynamism and storytelling.
