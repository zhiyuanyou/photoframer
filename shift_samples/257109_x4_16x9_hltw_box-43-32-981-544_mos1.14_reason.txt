To enhance the composition of the original image, adjust the framing by lowering the horizon line to include more of the water and the silhouettes of the cranes and structures. This change will create a stronger sense of depth and balance, as the expansive sky will be complemented by the reflective surface of the water. Additionally, ensure that the cranes are positioned slightly off-center to adhere to the rule of thirds, drawing the viewer's eye across the scene. This adjustment will emphasize the interplay between the dramatic sky and the industrial elements, creating a more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing image.
