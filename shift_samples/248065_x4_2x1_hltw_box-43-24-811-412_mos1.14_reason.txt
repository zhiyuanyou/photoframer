To enhance the composition, adjust the framing by lowering the horizon line to include more of the snowy landscape and the silhouetted trees. This change will create a stronger sense of depth and balance, as the snow-covered ground will add visual weight to the bottom of the frame. Additionally, ensure that the sun is visible near the horizon, adding a warm glow and focal point that draws the viewer's eye. This adjustment will transform the image from a simple sky view into a more dynamic and immersive winter scene.
