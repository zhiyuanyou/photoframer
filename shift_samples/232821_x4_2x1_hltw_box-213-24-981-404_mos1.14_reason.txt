To enhance the composition, reframe the image by zooming in slightly on the bird, ensuring it occupies a more central and prominent position within the frame. This adjustment draws attention directly to the bird, making it the clear focal point. Additionally, crop out some of the empty space around the edges, particularly on the left side, to eliminate distractions and create a tighter, more focused composition. The background should remain softly blurred to maintain the bokeh effect, but ensure that the waves and light reflections are still visible to provide context and depth. This reframing balances the subject with its environment, creating a more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing image.
