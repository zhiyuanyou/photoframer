To enhance the composition, crop the image to focus on the child holding the sign, ensuring they are centered and fully visible. Remove the blurred background elements that distract from the main subject, such as the indistinct faces and indistinct details. Adjust the framing to include more of the child’s upper body and face, emphasizing their expression and the message of the sign. This will create a clearer focal point and strengthen the emotional impact of the scene, making it more engaging and aesthetically balanced.
