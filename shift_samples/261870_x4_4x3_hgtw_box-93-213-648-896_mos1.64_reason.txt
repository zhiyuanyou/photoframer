To enhance the composition, adjust the framing by cropping out the lower portion of the image, focusing on the upper half where the silhouette of the boat and the sunset are more prominent. This change eliminates unnecessary water surface details, creating a cleaner and more balanced visual weight. By centering the boat horizontally and aligning it with the reflection of the sun, the composition becomes more symmetrical and aesthetically pleasing. The reduced water area draws attention to the warm hues of the sunset and the silhouette, emphasizing the serene and tranquil mood of the scene. This modification ensures the viewer's focus remains on the key elements without distraction.
