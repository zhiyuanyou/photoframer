To enhance the composition, crop the image slightly closer to the subjects' faces, ensuring they are centered and more prominent. Remove any unnecessary background elements that distract from the focus on the individuals. Adjust the framing so that the lights in the background create a soft bokeh effect, adding depth without overpowering the subjects. This tighter crop will emphasize their expressions and attire, making them the clear focal point while maintaining a balanced and aesthetically pleasing composition.
