To enhance the composition, crop the image to focus on the central area where the tram tracks lead into the frame, creating a strong leading line that draws the viewer's eye deeper into the scene. Remove the lower portion of the snowy sidewalk, which appears less dynamic and reduces visual clutter. Adjust the framing to include more of the illuminated building and its festive decorations, such as the "Cafe" sign and the Christmas tree, to emphasize the warm, inviting atmosphere. This shift balances the composition by highlighting the architectural details and the activity around them, making the scene feel more vibrant and engaging.
