To enhance the composition, crop the image to focus on the bird and the skull, removing the excess white space around them. This adjustment centers the bird more prominently, emphasizing its vibrant colors and dynamic pose. By eliminating the unnecessary background, the viewer's attention is drawn directly to the interaction between the bird and the skull, creating a stronger focal point. Additionally, this tighter framing reduces distractions and adds a sense of intimacy, making the scene feel more intentional and aesthetically pleasing. The result is a more balanced and impactful image that highlights the subject matter effectively.
