To enhance the composition, crop the image to focus on the boat and the small structure near the water's edge. Remove the top portion of the image where the sky dominates, as it adds little visual interest and detracts from the main subjects. Shift the framing slightly downward to emphasize the reflection of the boat in the water, creating a stronger visual connection between the foreground and background. This adjustment will draw attention to the boat's vibrant colors and the rustic charm of the structure, improving overall balance and harmony. Additionally, eliminate any unnecessary elements on the far right to streamline the composition and create a cleaner, more focused aesthetic.
