To enhance the composition, crop the image to focus on the person sitting on the graffiti-covered rock, ensuring they are fully visible and centered. Remove the top portion of the image where the sky dominates, as this reduces the emphasis on the expansive landscape and creates a more balanced frame. By doing so, the vibrant colors of the graffiti and the person's interaction with the environment become the primary focal points, drawing the viewer's attention to the foreground. This adjustment also eliminates unnecessary distractions, such as the distant horizon, making the overall composition more dynamic and engaging.
