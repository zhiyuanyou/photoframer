To enhance the composition, crop the image slightly closer to the subject, focusing on her upper body and face while keeping her legs and boots visible. This adjustment removes unnecessary negative space around her, creating a more intimate and centered feel. Additionally, ensure the subject is positioned slightly off-center to adhere to the rule of thirds, drawing attention to her expression and the autumn leaves she holds. This framing emphasizes her connection to the natural surroundings and adds a sense of depth by including more of the blurred background, which complements the warm, golden tones of the scene.
