To enhance the composition, shift the framing by moving the boat slightly to the left, ensuring it aligns more centrally within the frame. This adjustment balances the visual weight between the boat and the expansive sunset, creating a more symmetrical and pleasing aesthetic. Additionally, crop out any unnecessary empty space on the right side to focus attention on the vibrant sunset and the silhouette of the boat. This tighter framing eliminates distractions and emphasizes the serene interplay between the warm hues of the sky and the calm waters, making the scene more dynamic and visually engaging.
