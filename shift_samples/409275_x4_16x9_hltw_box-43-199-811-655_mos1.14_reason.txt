To enhance the composition, shift the framing to include the horizon line and distant landscape, such as trees or hills, which will provide depth and context to the scene. This adjustment will balance the foreground (the grassy field) with the background, creating a more dynamic and visually engaging image. Additionally, ensure that the path leading through the field remains central, guiding the viewer's eye into the distance and adding a sense of journey or exploration. This broader perspective will also highlight the contrast between the golden and green areas, enriching the overall aesthetic appeal.
