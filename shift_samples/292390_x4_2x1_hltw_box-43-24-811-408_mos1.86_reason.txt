To enhance the composition, adjust the framing by lowering the horizon line to include more of the water body in the foreground. This change will create a stronger sense of depth and balance, as the water will act as a leading line that draws the viewer's eye towards the mountains. Additionally, ensure the tree on the left is fully visible, as its current partial inclusion disrupts the natural flow of the scene. By incorporating these elements, the image will achieve a more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing composition, emphasizing the harmony between land, water, and sky.
