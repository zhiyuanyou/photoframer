To enhance the composition, adjust the framing by centering both dogs more prominently in the scene. Ensure they are fully visible, with their entire bodies including their heads and legs, to emphasize their playful energy. Remove any distracting elements on the left side, such as the partial view of the dog, to create a cleaner focus on the two main subjects. Additionally, slightly increase the depth of field to keep the background softly blurred, ensuring the dogs remain the focal point. This adjustment balances the composition, highlights the dynamic movement of the dogs, and creates a more engaging and aesthetically pleasing image.
