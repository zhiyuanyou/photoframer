To enhance the composition, crop the image slightly closer to the clock tower on the left, ensuring it occupies a more prominent position in the frame. This adjustment draws attention to the tower as a focal point and balances the visual weight against the broader urban landscape. Additionally, remove the lower portion of the canal wall on the right side to eliminate unnecessary blank space and create a cleaner, more dynamic leading line towards the illuminated buildings. These changes improve symmetry, focus, and overall aesthetic appeal by emphasizing key architectural elements and reducing distractions.
