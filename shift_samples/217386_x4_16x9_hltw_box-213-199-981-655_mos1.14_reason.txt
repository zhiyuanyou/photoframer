To enhance the composition, adjust the framing by cropping out the lower portion of the field, focusing on the upper half where the white structure stands prominently against the tree line. This change emphasizes the contrast between the bright field and the darker trees, creating a stronger visual hierarchy. Additionally, include more of the sky above the trees to introduce a sense of openness and balance the vertical elements. This modification draws attention to the structure as the central subject, while the remaining greenery provides a natural frame, improving overall harmony and aesthetic appeal.
