To enhance the composition, reframe the image by centering the bird more prominently within the frame. This adjustment ensures the bird is the clear focal point, drawing attention to its dynamic flight. Remove the distracting empty space on the left side, which currently lacks visual interest, and ensure the branches on the right do not dominate the foreground. By balancing the elements, the composition becomes more cohesive, emphasizing the bird's movement against the soft, blurred background. This shift creates a stronger visual narrative, highlighting the bird's grace and the natural environment.
