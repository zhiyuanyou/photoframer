To enhance the composition of the original image, adjust the framing by lowering the horizon line to include more of the foreground, such as the road and any visible structures or vegetation. This change will create a stronger sense of depth and context, grounding the majestic mountains in their environment. Additionally, ensure that the road leads the viewer's eye towards the mountains, using the natural lines of the landscape to guide attention. This modification balances the vastness of the sky with the earthy tones of the foreground, making the overall scene more dynamic and engaging.
