To enhance the composition, adjust the framing by cropping out the lower portion of the rocky foreground, focusing more on the reflective water and the boat. This change removes unnecessary detail from the bottom, creating a cleaner and more balanced visual flow. By emphasizing the golden reflection of the sunset on the water, the image gains a stronger focal point and a more serene atmosphere. Additionally, this adjustment draws attention to the silhouette of the boat and its occupants, making them a more prominent subject against the vibrant backdrop. The result is a more cohesive and aesthetically pleasing composition that highlights the interplay between light, water, and the natural landscape.
