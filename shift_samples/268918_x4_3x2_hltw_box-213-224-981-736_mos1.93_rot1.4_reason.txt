To enhance the composition, crop the image slightly closer to the ship, removing some of the empty water space on the left side. This adjustment centers the ship more prominently within the frame, creating a stronger focal point and reducing visual imbalance. Additionally, trim the top margin to eliminate unnecessary sky, directing attention toward the ship and its reflection. These changes improve symmetry, emphasize the ship's details, and create a more dynamic interplay between the vessel, its reflection, and the urban backdrop. The tighter framing also adds a sense of intimacy and focus to the scene.
