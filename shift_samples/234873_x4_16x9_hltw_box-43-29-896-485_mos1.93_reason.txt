To enhance the composition, crop the image slightly closer to the lighthouse and house, focusing on their structures and the rocky foreground. Remove the excess empty space above the clouds to emphasize the dramatic sky and create a stronger visual connection between the elements. This adjustment draws attention to the lighthouse as the central subject, while the house adds depth and context. The tighter framing also balances the weight of the sky and sea, making the overall scene more dynamic and visually engaging.
