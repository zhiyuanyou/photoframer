To enhance the composition, crop the image to focus on the colorful birdhouse and its reflection in the water, placing them closer to the center. Remove the distracting empty branches on the left side to create a cleaner frame. Adjust the background by reducing the visible area of the bridge and distant trees, emphasizing the serene water and the birdhouse as the primary subjects. This shift draws attention to the vibrant colors and reflections, creating a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing image. The tighter framing also eliminates unnecessary elements, making the scene feel more intimate and focused.
