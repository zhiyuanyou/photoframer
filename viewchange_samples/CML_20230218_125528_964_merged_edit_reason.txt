To enhance the composition, reposition the viewpoint to capture a broader perspective of the architectural structure, focusing on its symmetry and grandeur. Place the entrance arches centrally to emphasize their repetitive pattern and create a strong visual rhythm. Eliminate distractions by framing the building against a clear sky, which will highlight its details and ornate carvings. Incorporate more of the surrounding environment, such as trees or other buildings, to provide context and scale. Adjust the angle slightly upward to reduce the dominance of the foreground pavement and include more of the upper architectural elements, enhancing the sense of height and elegance. This approach ensures the structure's beauty is fully showcased and balanced within its setting.
