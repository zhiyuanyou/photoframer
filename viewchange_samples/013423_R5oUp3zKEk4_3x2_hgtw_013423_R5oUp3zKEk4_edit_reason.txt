To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to include a broader horizon and distant cityscape, creating a sense of scale and context. Place the main street as a leading line that converges towards the center, drawing the viewer's eye deeper into the image. Remove any distracting elements near the edges, such as partial buildings or cluttered rooftops, to simplify the frame. Incorporate more sky to balance the dense urban structures and add a serene atmosphere. This change emphasizes the street's symmetry and the city's organized layout while providing a more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing perspective.
