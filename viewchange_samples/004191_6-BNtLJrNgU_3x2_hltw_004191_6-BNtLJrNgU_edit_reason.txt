To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to reveal more of the expansive landscape in the background, creating a sense of depth and scale. Place the rocky foreground as a leading element that draws the viewer's eye toward the distant hills and valleys. Remove any distracting elements, such as overgrown vegetation in the mid-ground, to emphasize the open scenery. Include more sky to balance the earthy tones of the rocks and trees, adding lightness and contrast. This shift will transform the focus from the immediate details to the broader, scenic vista, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal and providing context.
