To enhance the composition, reposition the viewpoint to focus on the dramatic, triangular shape of the cliff, ensuring its peak aligns centrally in the frame. Crop out unnecessary foreground elements and adjust the angle to emphasize the layered rock formations and greenery, creating a sense of depth. Include more of the open sea and distant horizon to provide context and balance, while maintaining the contrast between the rugged cliffs and the smooth water surface. This adjustment will highlight the natural beauty and grandeur of the landscape, drawing the viewer's eye naturally upward and outward.
