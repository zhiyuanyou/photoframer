To enhance the composition, adjust the framing to include more of the majestic snow-capped mountains in the background, creating a stronger sense of scale and grandeur. Move the tents slightly off-center to adhere to the rule of thirds, allowing them to act as focal points without dominating the scene. Remove any unnecessary foreground distractions, such as rocks or uneven grass patches, to simplify the visual path. Introduce more of the clear sky above the mountains to add contrast and balance, emphasizing the vastness of the landscape. This reorientation draws attention to the natural beauty while maintaining a harmonious relationship between the human element (tents) and the environment.
