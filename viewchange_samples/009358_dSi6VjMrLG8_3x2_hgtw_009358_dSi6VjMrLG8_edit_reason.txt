Adjust the viewpoint to elevate the horizon line slightly, ensuring the turquoise lake occupies a larger portion of the upper frame. This change emphasizes the expansive water body and its reflection, enhancing the sense of tranquility and depth. Additionally, include more of the dramatic mountain peaks in the background to balance the composition and add visual interest. Position the winding path diagonally across the foreground to lead the viewer’s eye into the scene, creating a dynamic flow that draws attention to the natural beauty of the landscape. Finally, ensure the vibrant yellow flowers remain prominent in the midground, adding color contrast and texture to the overall aesthetic.
