To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to include more of the distant horizon and open sky, creating a sense of depth and scale. Place the shrubs in the foreground to frame the scene naturally, while allowing the calm sea and distant landmasses to occupy the middle ground. This layered structure will balance the image and draw the viewer's eye outward. Additionally, ensure the lighting emphasizes the warm tones of the shrubs against the cooler hues of the water, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal. Finally, include a portion of the clear sky to add contrast and complete the tranquil coastal atmosphere.
