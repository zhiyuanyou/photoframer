To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to eliminate the wooden frame in the foreground, which currently draws attention away from the natural beauty of the scene. Shift the focus slightly upward to emphasize the waterfall cascading down the rocky cliff, creating a stronger vertical line that guides the viewer's eye through the image. Remove any distracting elements near the bottom of the frame, such as the signpost, to allow the forest floor and autumn leaves to blend seamlessly into the scene. This change will create a more balanced and immersive view, highlighting the serene interaction between the waterfall and the surrounding trees.
