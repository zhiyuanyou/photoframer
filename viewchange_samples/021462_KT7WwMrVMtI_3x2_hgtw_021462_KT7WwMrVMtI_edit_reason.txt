To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to emphasize the urban landscape's symmetry and flow. Shift the focus slightly upward to include more of the city skyline in the background, balancing the foreground's highway intricate with the vertical lines of buildings. Reduce the prominence of the dark green trees by framing them as a natural element that contrasts with the urban structure rather than dominating the scene. Ensure the highway curves lead the viewer's eye into the distance, creating a sense of depth and movement. This adjustment will harmonize the natural and built environments, making the image more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing.
