To enhance the composition, reframe the image to focus more on the distant shoreline and buildings, creating a stronger sense of depth and interest. Remove the boat's edge from the foreground, which currently divides the frame and draws attention away from the main subject. Instead, crop the image to emphasize the expansive water and the architectural details of the buildings nestled among trees. This adjustment will provide a cleaner, more balanced view that highlights the contrast between the natural landscape and human structures, resulting in a more aesthetically pleasing and cohesive image.
