To enhance the composition, reposition the tent slightly off-center toward the right, creating a stronger sense of balance and leading the viewer's eye through the scene. Remove any foreground distractions, such as the prominent branch in the lower-left corner, to simplify the visual path. Adjust the lighting to highlight the tent's glow against the dark, starry sky, emphasizing the contrast between the warm interior and the cold, snowy environment. Ensure the trees frame the tent naturally, adding depth and context without overpowering the main subject. This approach enhances the serene, contemplative mood and focuses attention on the interplay of light, shadow, and nature.
