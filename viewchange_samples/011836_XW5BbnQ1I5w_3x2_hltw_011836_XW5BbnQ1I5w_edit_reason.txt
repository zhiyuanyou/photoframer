To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to focus more on the vibrant yellow trees, ensuring they occupy a larger portion of the frame. Crop out the lower foreground rocks and dirt path to minimize distractions and emphasize the verticality of the trees. Shift the horizon line slightly higher to include more of the clear blue sky, which will balance the warm tones of the foliage and add depth. This change will highlight the contrast between the golden trees and the cool sky, creating a more striking and aesthetically pleasing image.
