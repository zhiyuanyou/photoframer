To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to focus more on the reflection of the mountain in the water, creating a symmetrical and balanced scene. Eliminate the rocky foreground by shifting the perspective slightly upward, which reduces visual clutter and emphasizes the serene stillness of the lake. Ensure the horizon line is straight and centered to maintain symmetry between the mountain and its reflection. This change directs attention to the majestic peak and its mirrored image, enhancing the sense of tranquility and natural beauty. Additionally, framing the scene with softer lighting or during golden hour can add warmth and depth, improving the overall aesthetic appeal.
