To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to focus on the dense forest by removing the road from the foreground. This change eliminates distractions and emphasizes the natural beauty and texture of the trees. Shift the framing slightly upward to capture more of the tree canopy, creating a sense of depth and majesty. The absence of the road allows the viewer to fully immerse in the forest's tranquility and complexity, making the image more cohesive and aesthetically pleasing.
