To enhance the composition of the original image, reposition the viewpoint to eliminate the foreground trees that partially obscure the lake's expanse. Focus on capturing more of the serene water surface, which serves as a striking visual element. Additionally, adjust the framing to include more of the majestic mountain range in the background, ensuring it dominates the upper portion of the image. This shift will emphasize the grandeur of the landscape and create a balanced contrast between the calm lake and the rugged peaks, enhancing the overall sense of scale and tranquility. Finally, ensure the horizon is level to maintain stability and harmony in the composition.
