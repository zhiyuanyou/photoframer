To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to focus more closely on the heart-shaped window, ensuring it becomes the central focal point. Crop out any unnecessary elements around the edges, such as excess wood paneling, to eliminate distractions and emphasize the symmetry of the window and its intricate design. Position the frame so that the heart shape is perfectly centered and aligned vertically, drawing attention to the vibrant greenery and delicate white flowers within. This tighter framing will highlight the contrast between the rustic wood and the lush foliage, creating a more intimate and visually striking image.
