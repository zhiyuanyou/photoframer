To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to focus solely on the palm trees, removing the foreground fence and architectural elements that distract from the natural subject. Place the tallest tree centrally to act as a strong vertical anchor, while slightly tilting the frame to add dynamic energy. Crop out any unnecessary branches or foliage at the edges to create a cleaner, more focused silhouette against the overcast sky. This change emphasizes the graceful form and texture of the palms, creating a more serene and aesthetically pleasing image.
