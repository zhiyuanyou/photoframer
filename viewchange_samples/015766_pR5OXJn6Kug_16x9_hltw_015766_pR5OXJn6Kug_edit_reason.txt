To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint by focusing on a single prominent leaf in the foreground, creating a clear point of interest. Shift the perspective slightly upward to minimize the dominance of the asphalt surface and emphasize the scattered leaves and their natural patterns. Include more of the background trees and foliage to add depth and context, ensuring the sun's glow is visible through the leaves to introduce warmth and contrast. This change directs the viewer’s gaze naturally along the path, enhancing the sense of movement and seasonal ambiance.
