To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to focus more centrally on the reflection of the mountain peaks in the lake, creating a symmetrical and balanced scene. Remove the prominent foreground rocks that distract from the water's surface and the mirrored effect. Shift the framing slightly upward to include more of the clear blue sky and clouds, which will add contrast and vibrancy to the image. Ensure the horizon line is straight and positioned closer to the middle of the frame for better balance between the mountains and the sky. This adjustment will emphasize the serene beauty and symmetry of the natural landscape.
