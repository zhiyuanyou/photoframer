To enhance the composition, zoom in closer to the deer, focusing on its face and upper body while excluding the lower part of the fence and some of the surrounding vegetation. This adjustment brings the deer into sharper focus, making it the clear subject of the image. By removing the bottom portion of the frame, you eliminate distractions and emphasize the animal’s expression and details, such as its antlers and fur texture. Additionally, this tighter crop creates a more intimate connection between the viewer and the deer, highlighting its natural beauty against the rustic backdrop. The result is a more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing composition that draws the eye directly to the subject.
