To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to include more of the architectural details and visual interest in the background. Focus on capturing the row of houses symmetrically, ensuring they align horizontally across the frame. Remove the empty foreground by shifting the emphasis upward, creating a stronger sense of depth and balance. Incorporate elements like trees or street lamps to add texture and lead the viewer's eye through the scene. Eliminate distractions such as the black object on the right side, which currently disrupts the flow. Finally, ensure the lighting emphasizes the warm tones of the rooftops and the clean lines of the buildings, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal.
