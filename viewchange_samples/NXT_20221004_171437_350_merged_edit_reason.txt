To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to center the Capitol building more prominently within the frame, ensuring its architectural details are fully visible and symmetrical. Remove the large tree on the left side, which partially obstructs the view and draws attention away from the main subject. Instead, include more of the surrounding greenery and open lawn to create a balanced and harmonious foreground. Position the American flag pole slightly off-center to add visual interest without dominating the scene. Finally, ensure the horizon is level to maintain stability and emphasize the grandeur of the building against the sky. These changes will highlight the Capitol's iconic features and improve overall aesthetic appeal.
