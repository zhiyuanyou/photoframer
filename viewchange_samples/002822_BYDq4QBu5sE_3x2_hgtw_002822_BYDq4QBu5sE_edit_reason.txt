To enhance the composition of the waterfall scene, adjust the framing to center the waterfall more prominently within the image. This will draw the viewer's eye directly to the cascading water as the focal point. Eliminate any unnecessary foreground distractions, such as the rocky ledge at the bottom, to create a cleaner and more focused view. Increase the inclusion of the lush greenery and trees surrounding the waterfall to emphasize the natural beauty and depth of the scene. This balanced approach highlights the contrast between the vibrant blue water and the rugged cliffs, enhancing the overall visual impact and harmony.
