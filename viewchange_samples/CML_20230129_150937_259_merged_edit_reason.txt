To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to focus more on the expansive green field and the distant cityscape, creating a stronger sense of depth and scale. Place the horizon line higher in the frame to emphasize the vastness of the open space and the urban skyline beyond. Remove distractions such as the fence and people near the bottom, allowing the viewer's eye to flow freely across the field. Incorporate more of the palm trees and surrounding buildings to add texture and context without overcrowding the scene. This shift will balance the natural and urban elements, highlighting the contrast between the serene park and the bustling city.
