To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to emphasize the striking red rock formation in the background, making it a dominant feature. Place the rocky cliffs higher in the frame to create a sense of grandeur and scale. Reduce the prominence of the foreground grasses by lowering their visual weight, perhaps through selective blurring or tonal adjustments, allowing the trees to act as a natural frame between the viewer and the cliffs. Ensure the sky occupies a balanced portion of the upper frame, with clouds adding texture without overpowering the scene. This reorientation draws attention to the contrast between the rugged terrain and the vibrant greenery, creating a more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing image.
