To enhance the composition, adjust the framing to include more of the sky and the silhouettes of the trees against it. Place the horizon higher in the frame to emphasize the vastness of the snowy landscape and the stark contrast between the dark trees and the light snow. Remove any distractions near the bottom edge, such as minor debris or uneven snow patches, to maintain a clean and serene aesthetic. This shift creates a more balanced and visually striking image, focusing on the interplay of light, shadow, and texture in the winter scene.
