To enhance the composition, reposition the person closer to the center of the frame, ensuring they are more prominently featured while still capturing the expansive landscape. Eliminate any distractions in the foreground, such as unnecessary rocks or debris, to maintain focus on the subject and the scenic background. Adjust the angle slightly to include more of the winding river and the distant mountains, creating a sense of depth and scale. This change balances the human element with the natural beauty, emphasizing the interaction between the photographer and the environment. Finally, ensure the horizon line is straight to avoid tilting and maintain visual stability.
