To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to include the full length of the red carpet, ensuring it leads directly into the distance and creates a strong visual pathway. Position the carpet slightly off-center to add dynamism, while maintaining symmetry with the lanterns flanking it. Remove any distractions near the foreground, such as partial objects or uneven ground, to keep the focus sharp. Elevate the perspective slightly to emphasize the vastness of the desert and the continuity of the carpet, enhancing the sense of depth and grandeur. This adjustment ensures the carpet becomes the central element, drawing the viewer's eye toward the horizon and creating a balanced, harmonious scene.
