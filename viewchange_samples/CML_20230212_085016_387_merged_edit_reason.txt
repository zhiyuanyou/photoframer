To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to eliminate the boat's edge from the foreground, allowing the vast expanse of water and dramatic mountain range to take center stage. This change removes visual clutter and directs focus entirely on the natural elements, creating a more immersive and expansive feel. Additionally, ensure the horizon is level to maintain balance and stability in the frame. This adjustment emphasizes the grandeur of the mountains and the serene water, enhancing the overall aesthetic by highlighting the raw beauty of the landscape.
