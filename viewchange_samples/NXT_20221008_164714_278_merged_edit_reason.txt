To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to focus on the dramatic interplay between the clouds and the landscape. Place the horizon line higher in the frame to emphasize the expansive sky and cloud cover, creating a sense of grandeur and scale. Remove the signpost from the right side to eliminate distractions and allow the natural elements to take center stage. Shift slightly to include more of the tree line at the edge of the cloud layer, which will add depth and visual interest. This change directs attention to the contrast between the earthy tones below and the ethereal quality of the clouds above, resulting in a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing image.
