To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to emphasize the expansive coastal landscape while reducing the prominence of the dry, thorny foreground vegetation. Shift focus slightly upward to reveal more of the serene ocean horizon and the distant coastline, creating a sense of depth and vastness. Crop out some of the distracting, dense vegetation in the lower portion, allowing the natural beauty of the flowers and the open sky to take center stage. This change balances the elements, highlighting the contrast between the rugged terrain and the tranquil sea, resulting in a more harmonious and aesthetically pleasing image.
