To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to reveal more of the snowy mountain peak, which will serve as a focal point and add visual interest. Place the trees closer to the bottom of the frame to create a natural framing effect, drawing the viewer's eye upward toward the mountain. Remove any unnecessary branches or distractions in the foreground that do not contribute to the overall aesthetic. Ensure the sky occupies a balanced portion of the upper frame to provide context and contrast with the dark green foliage. This adjustment will emphasize the grandeur of the landscape while maintaining a harmonious balance between the elements.
