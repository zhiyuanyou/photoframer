To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to capture the entire façade of the building symmetrically, ensuring the architectural details are evenly distributed across the frame. Place the horizon line slightly below the midpoint to emphasize the grandeur of the structure and its domes. Remove any distracting foreground elements, such as lamp posts or partial figures, to focus attention on the building itself. Incorporate more of the clear blue sky to provide contrast and balance, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal. This repositioning will highlight the symmetry and intricate design of the architecture while creating a more harmonious and visually striking image.
