To enhance the composition of the original image, reposition the viewpoint to include more of the distant mountain range and the expansive sky above the lake. This adjustment will add depth and context, creating a more dramatic and balanced scene. Focus on capturing the lake's vibrant blue color against the rugged terrain, ensuring the horizon line is slightly off-center to adhere to the rule of thirds. Eliminate foreground distractions by framing the rocky slope more subtly, allowing the viewer’s eye to travel naturally from the foreground to the background. This change emphasizes the grandeur of the landscape and the interplay between land, water, and sky.
