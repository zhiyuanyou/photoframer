To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to place the docked building more centrally within the frame, ensuring it is the focal point. Remove the dense foliage from the foreground by shifting the perspective slightly, allowing the water and distant hills to play a more prominent role in the scene. This change creates a clearer visual path from the foreground to the background, improving depth and balance. Additionally, ensure the horizon line is straight and positioned near the upper third of the image, adhering to the rule of thirds for a more aesthetically pleasing result. This adjustment minimizes distractions and emphasizes the serene, natural setting.
