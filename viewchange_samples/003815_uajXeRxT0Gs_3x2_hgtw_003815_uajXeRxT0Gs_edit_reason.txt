To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to emphasize the natural curves and flow of the river, creating a more dynamic leading line that draws the viewer's eye into the scene. Shift the focus slightly upward to include more of the striking red rock formations, which will add depth and visual interest. Crop out the lower foreground rocks that currently dominate the bottom of the frame, reducing clutter and allowing the river and cliffs to take center stage. This repositioning will also highlight the contrast between the calm water and rugged terrain, enhancing the overall aesthetic balance.
