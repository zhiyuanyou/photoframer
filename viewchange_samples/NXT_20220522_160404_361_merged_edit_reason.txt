To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to center the clock more prominently within the frame, ensuring it is directly aligned with the architectural symmetry of the space. Remove any distracting elements below the clock, such as the lower decorative details, to focus attention on the intricate design and Roman numerals. Increase the visibility of the arched ceiling and skylights above, which will add depth and highlight the ornate metalwork. This shift creates a balanced, symmetrical composition that emphasizes the grandeur and elegance of the setting.
