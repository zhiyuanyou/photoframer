To enhance the composition, reposition the viewpoint to focus more closely on the waterfall, capturing its full height and the cascading ice formations. Place the waterfall centrally to emphasize its vertical flow and the dynamic interplay between water and ice. Remove the lower portion of the snow-covered slope to reduce visual clutter and draw attention to the dramatic textures of the frozen waterfall. Include more of the rocky cliff face to provide context and contrast, enhancing the overall sense of scale and natural beauty. This adjustment creates a more balanced and striking visual narrative centered on the frozen waterfall.
