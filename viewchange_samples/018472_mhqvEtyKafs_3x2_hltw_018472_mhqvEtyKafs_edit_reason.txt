To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to eliminate the foreground roof edge, which currently divides the frame and distracts from the natural landscape. Place the horizon line slightly below the midpoint to emphasize the vastness of the desert and the scattered trees, creating a more balanced and open feel. Remove any man-made elements that intrude into the scene, such as the visible structure on the left, to maintain the serene and untouched quality of the environment. This change will allow the viewer to focus entirely on the natural beauty and the interplay between the trees, shrubs, and distant mountains, enhancing the overall aesthetic appeal.
