To enhance the composition, reposition the viewpoint to focus solely on the urban skyline at night, eliminating the foreground vegetation and pole. This simplifies the scene, allowing the illuminated buildings to become the central visual element. By removing distractions such as the natural elements and the pole, the viewer's attention is drawn directly to the architectural details and the interplay of light and shadow. The resulting image will emphasize symmetry, depth, and the vibrant cityscape, creating a more cohesive and aesthetically pleasing photograph.
