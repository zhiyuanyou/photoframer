To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to place the white dome structure more centrally and prominently, ensuring it becomes the focal point. Remove the golden sculpture from the foreground by shifting the perspective slightly, as it currently draws attention away from the building. Include more of the surrounding greenery and palm trees to frame the dome naturally and add depth. Reduce the prominence of the steps and people in the foreground to minimize distractions and emphasize the architectural beauty of the dome. This repositioning creates a balanced and harmonious scene that highlights the structure's grandeur and symmetry.
