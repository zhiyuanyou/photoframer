To enhance the composition, zoom in slightly on the swan, placing it more centrally within the frame to draw focus to its elegant form and reflection. Crop out the lower portion of the image to eliminate the concrete edge, which currently distracts from the natural setting. This adjustment will emphasize the serene interaction between the swan and the water, creating a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing image that highlights the subject's grace and the tranquil environment.
