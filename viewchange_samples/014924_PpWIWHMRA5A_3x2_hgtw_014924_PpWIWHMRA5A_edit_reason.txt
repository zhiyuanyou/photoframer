To enhance the composition of the image, adjust the viewpoint to emphasize the winding river as the focal point, allowing it to lead the viewer's eye through the scene naturally. Place the river more centrally and ensure it curves gracefully across the frame, creating a dynamic flow. Remove the lower foreground grasses that obscure the river’s path, ensuring the water remains the primary subject. Additionally, include more of the distant hills and adjust the framing to balance the greenery with the open sky, adding depth and context to the landscape. This repositioning will highlight the natural beauty and harmony of the environment.
