To enhance the composition, reposition the viewpoint to focus on the snow-covered trees and the fence as leading lines that guide the viewer's eye into the scene. Place the fence diagonally across the frame to create dynamic movement and depth. Remove any distracting foreground elements, such as prominent twigs or uneven snow patches, to simplify the visual narrative. Include more of the background forest to emphasize the serene, expansive winter landscape. Adjust the framing to balance the light and shadow areas, ensuring the snow glistens while maintaining the mood of the scene. This approach highlights the natural beauty and tranquility of the snowy environment.
