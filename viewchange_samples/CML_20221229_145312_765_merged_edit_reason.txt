To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to include more of the cascading waterfalls in the background, creating a sense of depth and scale. Position the wooden railing on the left side to frame the scene naturally without obstructing key elements. Focus on capturing the interplay between the flowing water, moss-covered rocks, and lush greenery, which adds vibrancy and texture. Remove any unnecessary foreground distractions, such as the ground near the railing, to emphasize the dynamic movement of the water and the serene forest setting. This shift will balance the elements and draw the viewer's eye through the image, highlighting the natural beauty of the landscape.
