To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to include more of the expansive landscape and distant horizon, creating a sense of scale and grandeur. Place the rocky foreground as a leading element that draws the viewer's eye into the deeper layers of the canyon. Remove any unnecessary distractions in the lower portion of the frame, such as uneven or cluttered rock formations, to emphasize the smooth flow of the terrain. Incorporate more of the clear blue sky to balance the earthy tones of the rocks and add visual interest. This change will highlight the natural beauty and vastness of the scene, making it more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing.
