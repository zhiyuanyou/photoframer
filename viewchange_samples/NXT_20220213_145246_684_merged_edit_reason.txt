To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to eliminate the foreground rocks and focus more on the expansive water and distant island. Place the horizon slightly above the midpoint to emphasize the vastness of the sea and sky, creating a balanced yet dynamic scene. Remove any obstructions near the edges (like the dark vertical element) to open up the frame and allow the viewer’s eye to flow freely across the water. Position the sailboat closer to the center or slightly off-center to serve as a focal point without dominating the tranquil setting. This adjustment will highlight the natural beauty and serenity of the seascape.
