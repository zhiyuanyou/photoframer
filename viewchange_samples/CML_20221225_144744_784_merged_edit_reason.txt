To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to place the dome of the building more centrally and prominently within the frame, ensuring it becomes the focal point. Remove the foreground trees that partially obscure the structure, allowing the full grandeur of the architecture to be appreciated. Shift the angle slightly upward to emphasize the height and symmetry of the building against the clear blue sky. This change will create a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing image, highlighting the historical and architectural significance of the scene. Additionally, consider reducing distractions such as the yellow structure on the right side to maintain visual harmony.
