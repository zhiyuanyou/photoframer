To enhance the composition, adjust the framing to focus more closely on the aspen trees, cropping out the lower portion of the grassy field. This change emphasizes the vibrant yellow foliage and creates a stronger visual impact by filling the frame with the trees' striking colors. By removing excess foreground, the viewer's attention is drawn directly to the vertical lines of the trunks and the contrast between the bright leaves and the darker background. This tighter crop also adds depth and draws the eye upward, highlighting the natural beauty and uniformity of the forest.
