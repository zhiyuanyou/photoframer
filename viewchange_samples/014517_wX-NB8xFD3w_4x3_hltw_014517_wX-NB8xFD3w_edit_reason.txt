To enhance the composition, reframe the image to include more of the dramatic mountain range in the background, which will add depth and grandeur. Shift the focus slightly upward to emphasize the towering peaks and their rugged textures, creating a striking contrast against the serene lake. Position the lone tree closer to the center to act as a focal point, drawing the viewer's eye and adding visual interest. Eliminate the foreground pavement to reduce distractions and allow the natural elements—such as the tree, water, and mountains—to take precedence. This adjustment will create a more balanced and aesthetically pleasing image that highlights the beauty of the landscape.
