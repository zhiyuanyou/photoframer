To enhance the composition, focus solely on the palm tree and rainbow, removing the building from the frame. Place the tree centrally to emphasize its natural elegance and allow the rainbow to arc gracefully across the clear sky, creating a strong visual contrast. Eliminate distractions such as the balcony and roofline, which currently compete for attention. This adjustment will highlight the serene beauty of the scene, balancing the vibrant colors of the rainbow against the lush green foliage and the soft blue sky. The result will be a more harmonious and aesthetically pleasing image that draws the viewer’s eye naturally to the interplay between nature’s elements.
