To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to emphasize the rugged texture and layered rock formations of the mountains. Place the rocky outcrop more centrally to draw attention to its intricate details and natural patterns. Reduce the prominence of the foreground shrubs by shifting focus slightly upward, allowing the viewer to appreciate the contrast between the arid landscape and the dramatic peaks. Incorporate more of the sky to add depth and balance, ensuring the clouds complement the mountain's silhouette without overpowering it. This repositioning creates a harmonious blend of earthy tones and dynamic shapes, highlighting the raw beauty of the desert terrain.
