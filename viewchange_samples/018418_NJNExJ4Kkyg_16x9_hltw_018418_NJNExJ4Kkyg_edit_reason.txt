To enhance the composition, reposition the viewpoint to include more of the expansive ocean and distant horizon, creating a sense of scale and depth. Shift focus slightly upward to minimize the dominance of the sandy foreground and emphasize the rugged textures of the cliffs. Incorporate more sky to balance the heavy rock formations and add visual interest with clouds or clear blue tones. This adjustment will draw the viewer's eye across the scene, from the detailed cliff textures to the vastness of the sea and horizon, resulting in a more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing image.
