To enhance the composition, reposition the viewpoint to include more of the surrounding snowy landscape and trees, creating a sense of depth and context. Place the bench centrally in the foreground to act as a focal point and lead the viewer's eye towards the rustic wooden cabin. Adjust the framing to exclude the lower portion of the cabin's siding, focusing instead on the upper half and the roofline, which adds visual interest and emphasizes the texture of the wood. Incorporate the bare tree branches into the upper left corner to introduce natural lines and balance the composition. This shift creates a serene winter scene that highlights the interplay between man-made structures and nature.
