Adjust the viewpoint to focus on the street's vanishing point, creating a strong leading line that draws the viewer's eye into the scene. Place the parked cars and storefronts symmetrically along the sides to balance the composition. Remove the partial car in the foreground to eliminate distractions and emphasize the snowy street and buildings. Include more of the sky to add depth and context, enhancing the wintry atmosphere. This shift will create a more dynamic and aesthetically pleasing image.
