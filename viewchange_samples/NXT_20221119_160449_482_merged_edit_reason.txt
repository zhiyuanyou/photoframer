To enhance the composition, adjust the viewpoint to place the palm trees more centrally and symmetrically, framing the white dome structure behind them. Remove the yellow chairs from the foreground to eliminate distractions and create a cleaner, more open space. Lower the horizon line slightly to emphasize the expansive green lawn and the architectural details of the dome. This change will balance the natural and man-made elements, draw the viewer's eye towards the focal point (the dome), and provide a sense of tranquility and symmetry.
