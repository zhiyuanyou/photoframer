To enhance the composition, crop closer to the batter, catcher, and umpire, eliminating excess field space. This focuses attention on the action and interaction among these key figures. Position the batter slightly off-center to follow the rule of thirds, creating a balanced and engaging frame. Removing the top and bottom edges reduces distractions, ensuring the viewer's eye remains on the main subjects for a more dynamic and intimate scene.
