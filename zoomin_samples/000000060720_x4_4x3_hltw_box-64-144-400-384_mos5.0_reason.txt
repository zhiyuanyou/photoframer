To enhance the composition of the image, zoom in slightly to crop out the unnecessary foreground grass and background elements, such as the distant trees and buildings. Focus on framing the two individuals playing frisbee more tightly, ensuring they occupy a central yet dynamic position within the frame. This adjustment removes distractions and emphasizes their interaction and movement. Additionally, align the players along a horizontal axis to create balance, while keeping the frisbee visible as a key focal point. This reframing creates a cleaner, more engaging composition that highlights the action and energy of the scene.
