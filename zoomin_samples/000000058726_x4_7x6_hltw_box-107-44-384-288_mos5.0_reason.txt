To enhance the composition, zoom in on the giraffe in the foreground, removing the distant giraffe and fence. This eliminates distractions and focuses attention on the main subject. Position the giraffe slightly off-center to follow the rule of thirds. The tighter frame also captures more detail and texture, creating a more intimate and visually appealing image.
