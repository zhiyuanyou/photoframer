To enhance the composition of the image, zoom in and reframe to focus closely on the two individuals interacting on the tennis court. Eliminate the unnecessary background by cropping out the audience and the expansive court lines, which currently distract from the main subjects. This tighter framing centers the interaction, emphasizing their body language and expressions. By keeping the subjects slightly off-center, the rule of thirds is applied, adding visual interest. The adjusted composition simplifies the scene, directing attention to the dynamic between the players and creating a more intimate and engaging atmosphere.
