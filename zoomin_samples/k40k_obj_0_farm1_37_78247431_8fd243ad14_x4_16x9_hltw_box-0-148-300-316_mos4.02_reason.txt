To improve the composition of the large image, zoom in and reframe the shot to focus on the tall, illuminated building as the central subject. Crop out the lower portion of the river and bridge, reducing visual clutter and directing attention upward toward the building and sky. Shift the framing slightly to place the building more centrally, adhering to the rule of thirds, which creates a more balanced and dynamic composition. This adjustment eliminates some of the surrounding structures and trees that distract from the main subject, emphasizing the building’s height and the dramatic sky. The tighter frame also enhances the mood by focusing on the interplay between light and shadow, as well as the contrast between the urban skyline and the serene river.
