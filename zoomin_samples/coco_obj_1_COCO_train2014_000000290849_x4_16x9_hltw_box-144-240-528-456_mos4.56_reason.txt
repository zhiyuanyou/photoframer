To enhance the composition of the image, zoom in and reframe to focus on the bus as the central subject, eliminating unnecessary foreground elements like the person walking and the parked cars on the left. This adjustment reduces distractions and directs attention to the bus's vibrant colors and movement. Shift the framing slightly to place the bus near the center but not perfectly aligned, adhering to the rule of thirds for a more dynamic feel. By removing the lower portion of the image, including the road markings and some vehicles, the composition becomes cleaner and more focused, emphasizing the bus's journey against the backdrop of the large building and flags. This reframing creates a stronger visual narrative and balance.
