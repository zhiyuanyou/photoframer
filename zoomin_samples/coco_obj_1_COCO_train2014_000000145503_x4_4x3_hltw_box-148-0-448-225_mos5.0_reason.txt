To improve the composition, zoom in closer to the woman, focusing on her face and upper body while excluding the laptop and knitting materials. This shift centers attention on her expression and interaction with the knitting needles, creating a more intimate and engaging scene. By removing the laptop, you eliminate distractions and emphasize the personal, creative activity. Adjust the framing to place her slightly off-center, following the rule of thirds, which adds visual interest and balance. This tighter crop also simplifies the background, drawing the viewer’s eye to her actions and emotions, enhancing the overall aesthetic and narrative focus.
