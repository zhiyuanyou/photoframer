To enhance the composition of the image, zoom in and refocus on a single zebra grazing in the foreground, eliminating the other zebras and the expansive background. This change centers attention on the zebra's striking black-and-white stripes and its interaction with the grass, creating a more intimate and dynamic scene. By removing distractions such as the additional animals and distant trees, the composition becomes cleaner and more focused. The rule of thirds can be applied by positioning the zebra slightly off-center, allowing the lush green field and scattered shrubs to frame the subject naturally. This tighter framing also emphasizes texture and detail, making the image more engaging and aesthetically pleasing.
