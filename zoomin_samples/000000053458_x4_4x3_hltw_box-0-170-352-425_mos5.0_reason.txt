To enhance the composition, zoom in slightly to center the train more prominently. This adjustment reduces empty space on the sides, focusing attention on the train and its lights. Position the train off-center following the rule of thirds for a balanced look. Eliminate distractions like distant poles and shrubs to emphasize the train and the mountainous backdrop, creating a clearer, more engaging image.
