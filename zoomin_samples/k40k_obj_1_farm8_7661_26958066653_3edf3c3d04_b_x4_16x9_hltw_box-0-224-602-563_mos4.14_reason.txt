To enhance the composition of the image, zoom in and reframe to focus on the narrow gauge train as the central subject, eliminating unnecessary foreground elements like the road and the distant house. This adjustment brings attention to the train's details and its interaction with the landscape, such as the vibrant orange flowers and rolling hills. By placing the train slightly off-center, following the rule of thirds, the composition becomes more dynamic and balanced. The tighter frame also reduces distractions from peripheral elements, emphasizing the harmony between the train and the scenic backdrop, creating a more cohesive and aesthetically pleasing image.
