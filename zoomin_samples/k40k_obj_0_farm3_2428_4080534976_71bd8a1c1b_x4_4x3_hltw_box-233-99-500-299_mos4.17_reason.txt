To enhance the composition of the image, zoom in and reframe to focus on the lighthouse and its immediate surroundings. Crop out the top portion of the sky, which is mostly empty and does not add significant visual interest. Shift the framing slightly to bring the lighthouse and rocky outcrop closer to the center, emphasizing their prominence. Reduce the visible expanse of the ocean on the left side to create a more balanced and intimate view. This reframing brings attention to the interplay between the natural landscape and the man-made structure, enhancing the overall aesthetic by creating a more dynamic and focused scene.
