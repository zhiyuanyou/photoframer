To enhance the composition, zoom in on the kite surfer by cropping out the excess water and sky at the top and bottom. This adjustment brings the surfer into the foreground, making him the central focus. By removing the distant background details, such as the buildings and mountains, the image becomes less cluttered and more dynamic. Additionally, reposition the surfer slightly to the left, adhering to the rule of thirds, which creates a more balanced and engaging visual flow. This reframing emphasizes the action and energy of the sport while maintaining a clean, aesthetically pleasing composition.
