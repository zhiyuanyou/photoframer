To enhance the composition, zoom in and refocus the frame on the organ grinder and his ornate cart, eliminating the surrounding distractions such as the parked cars and distant people. This tightens the shot, drawing attention to the central subject and his interaction with the woman in traditional attire. By placing the organ grinder slightly off-center (following the rule of thirds), the composition becomes more dynamic. The foreground elements, like the small white dog and the trunk, add depth and interest, while the background trees provide a natural backdrop without overpowering the main subjects. This reframing creates a more intimate and focused scene that emphasizes the cultural and historical context of the setting.
