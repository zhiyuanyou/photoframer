To improve the composition of the image, zoom in slightly to focus on the person standing on the platform, ensuring they are centered or positioned slightly off-center according to the rule of thirds. Crop out any unnecessary background elements, such as the blurred train details on the far left, to reduce distractions and emphasize the subject. Adjust the framing so that the person’s back and the backpack are more prominent, creating a stronger focal point. This tighter crop also enhances the sense of depth by keeping the moving train in the background while highlighting the stillness of the subject. The result is a cleaner, more dynamic composition that directs attention to the individual and their interaction with the urban environment.
