To enhance the composition, zoom in on the surfer and wave, removing the top-left tree branches and bottom-right observer. This tight framing focuses attention on the surfer's action and the wave's texture. Centering the surfer within the wave adheres to the rule of thirds, creating balance. Eliminating distractions sharpens the viewer's focus, resulting in a more dynamic and engaging image.
