To enhance the composition, zoom in slightly to center the train more prominently. Remove excess sky and distant hills to minimize distractions. Position the train off-center following the rule of thirds for balance. This tighter framing focuses attention on the train and its passengers, creating a more engaging and aesthetically pleasing image with improved depth and visual interest.
