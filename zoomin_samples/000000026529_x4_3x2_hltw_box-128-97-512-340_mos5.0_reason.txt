To enhance the composition, zoom in on the skier, centering them more prominently. Remove the top portion with the banner and people in the background to minimize distractions. Position the skier slightly off-center to follow the rule of thirds. This tighter framing focuses attention on the skier's action and the snowy slope, creating a dynamic and engaging image.
