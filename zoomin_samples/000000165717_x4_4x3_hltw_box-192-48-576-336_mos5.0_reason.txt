To enhance the composition, zoom in slightly to center the rider and horse more prominently. This adjustment reduces excess empty space, focusing attention on the subject. Position the rider off-center following the rule of thirds for balance. Eliminate distractions at the edges, ensuring the horizon line remains straight. This tighter framing creates a more engaging and aesthetically pleasing image.
