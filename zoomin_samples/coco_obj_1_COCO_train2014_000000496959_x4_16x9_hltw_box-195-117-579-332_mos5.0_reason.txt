To improve the composition of the image, zoom in and crop the scene to focus more tightly on the cat and the ornate green bench. Eliminate the excess yellow wall space above and below the bench, which currently dominates the frame. By reframing, the cat becomes the central subject, drawing immediate attention due to its position and the contrast against the vibrant green background. This tighter crop also accentuates the intricate details of the bench's design, creating a more dynamic and engaging visual. Additionally, removing the empty space around the edges reduces distractions and emphasizes the harmony between the cat and its environment, adhering to the rule of thirds for a balanced and aesthetically pleasing result.
