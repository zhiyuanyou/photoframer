To enhance the composition, zoom in on the subject by cropping out the lower portion of the image, focusing on the man from just above his waist up. This adjustment eliminates unnecessary ground space, creating a more dynamic and centered composition. By keeping the subject slightly off-center (to the left), you adhere to the rule of thirds, adding visual interest. The tight framing also removes extraneous details in the background, such as the lower part of the building and the floor, which helps draw attention to the subject’s gesture and expression. The vibrant purple lighting behind him remains prominent but is now framed more intentionally, enhancing the overall aesthetic balance and focus.
